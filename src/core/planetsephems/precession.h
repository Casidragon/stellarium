//! Precession modelled from:
//! J. Vondr√°k, N. Capitaine, and P. Wallace: New precession expressions, valid for long time intervals
//! A&A (Astronomy&Astrophysics) 534, A22 (2011)
//! DOI: http://dx.doi.org/10.1051/0004-6361/201117274
//! This paper describes a precession model valid for +/-200.000 years from J2000.0.
//! Some better understanding of the angles can be found in:
//! 1994AJ____108__711W J.G.Williams: Contributions to the Earth's Obliquity Rate, Precession and Nutation
//! (Angles of eq. (35))
//! The angles computed therein are used to rotate the planet Earth, and also to rotate an "Ecliptic of Date", i.e. the current orbital plane of Earth.
//! Currently this is without Nutation.
//! TODO: Find IAU2000 Nutation and how this fits in here.

//! It seems the easiest solution is in fact the one also implemented in the paper,
//! combining matrix P from P_A, Q_A, X_A, Y_A and, for the ecliptic of date, rotate back by epsilon_A.
