# demo gazetteer for Gro√ümugl landscape.
# Can be used to better describe the landscape, 
# i.e. show labels on landscape features.
# Fields must be separated by vertical line, label must not have such a vertical line.
# Comments have this hash mark in first column. 
# coordinates in degrees from true North. 
# line towards top draws a single line strictly upward.
# label is centered on line endpoint. 
# Azimuth | Altitude | line-towards-top | azimuth shift | label
