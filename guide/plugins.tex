Since version 0.10.3, Stellarium's packages include a number of
plug-ins: Angle Measure, Compass Marks, Oculars, Telescope Control, Text
User Interface, Satellites, Solar System Editor, Time Zone, Historical
Supernovae, Quasars, Pulsars, Exoplanets and Observability analysis. All
these plug-ins are ``built-in'' in the standard Stellarium distribution
and DON'T need to be downloaded separately.

To enable a plugin:

\begin{enumerate}
\item
  Open the \textbf{Configuration dialog} (press F2 or use the left tool
  bar button)
\item
  Select the \textbf{Plugins} tab
\item
  Select the plugin you want to enable from the list
\item
  Check the \textbf{Load at startup} option
\item
  Restart Stellarium
\end{enumerate}

If the plugin has configuration options, the \textbf{configuration}
button will be enabled when the plugin is loaded and clicking it will
open the plugin's configuration window.

\section{Data for plugins}\label{data-for-plugins}

Some plugins contain files with different data, e.g. catalogs. JSON is a
typical format for those files and you can edit it's manually. Of
course, each plugin has specific format of data for the own catalogs and
you should read documentation for plugin before editing of it catalog.

You can read some common instructions for editing catalogs of plugins
below. In this example we use \texttt{catalog.json} file for
identification of catalog for typical plugin.

You can modify the \texttt{catalog.json} files manually using a text
editor. \textbf{If you are using Windows, it is strongly recommended to
use an advanced text editor such as
\href{http://notepad-plus-plus.org/}{Notepad++}} to avoid problems with
end-of-line characters. (It will also color the JSON code and make it
easier to read.)

\textbf{Warning}: Before editing your \texttt{catalog.json} file, make a
backup copy. Leaving out the smallest detail (such as a comma or
forgetting to close a curly bracket) will prevent Stellarium from
starting.

The path to the directory\footnote{This is a hidden folder, so in order to find it you may need to change your computer's settings to display hidden files and folders.} which contains \texttt{catalog.json} file is
something like:

\begin{itemize}
\item
  C:\textbackslash Users\textbackslash\textbf{UserName}\textbackslash AppData\textbackslash Roaming\textbackslash Stellarium\textbackslash modules\textbackslash \textit{PluginName}\\ (Windows)
\item
  \textbf{HomeDirectory}/Library/Preferences/Stellarium/modules/\textit{PluginName}\\ (Mac OS X)
\item
  \textasciitilde{}/.stellarium/modules/\textit{PluginName} (Linux and UNIX-like OS)
\end{itemize}
