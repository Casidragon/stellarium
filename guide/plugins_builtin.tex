\chapter{Built-in Plugins}
Since version 0.10.3, Stellarium's packages include a number of plug-ins.

\section{Angle Measure Plugin}
\label{sec:plugins:AngleMeasure}

%\url{http://porpoisehead.net/images/plugin-angle-measure.jpg}

The Angle Measure plugin is a small tool which is used to measure the
angular distance between two points on the sky. 

\small{*goes misty eyed*\\ 
I recall measuring the size of the Cassini Division when I was a student.
It was not the high academic glamor one might expect... It was cloudy...
It was rainy... The observatory lab had some old scopes set up at one
end, pointing at a \emph{photograph} of Saturn at the other end of the
lab. We measured. We calculated. We wished we were in Hawaii. A picture
is worth a thousand words.}

\subsection{Using the plugin}
\label{sec:plugins:AngleMeasure:using}

\begin{enumerate}
\item
  Enable the tool by clicking the tool-bar button, or by pressing
  \textbf{control-A}. A message will appear at the bottom of the screen
  to tell you that the tool is active.
\item
  Drag a line from the first point to the second point using the left
  mouse button
\item
  To clear the measurement, click the right mouse button
\item
  To deactivate the angle measure tool, press the tool-bar button again,
  or press \textbf{control-A} on the keyboard.
\end{enumerate}

\section{Bright Novae Plugin}
\label{sec:plugins:BrightNovae}

The Bright Novae plugin provides visualization of some bright novae in
the Milky Way galaxy (Fig.~\ref{fig:NovaCygni1975}).

%Example (\href{http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/V1500_Cygni}{\textbf{Nova
%Cygni 1975}}, also known as \textbf{V1500 Cyg}):

\begin{figure}[h]
\includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{NovaCygni1975wiki.jpg}
\label{fig:NovaCygni1975}
\caption{Nova Cygni 1975 (also known as \textbf{V1500 Cyg})}
\end{figure}

\subsection{Using the Bright Novae plugin}
\label{sec:plugins:BrighrNovae:using}

\begin{enumerate}
\item Enable the tool by clicking the tool-bar button ``Load at startup''
\item Set date and time (30 August 1975 year for \emph{Nova Cygni 1975} as example\footnote{\url{http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/V1500_Cygni}})
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Section \big[Novae\big] in config.ini file}
\label{sec:plugins:BrightNovae:config}

You can edit \file{config.ini} file by yourself for changes of the
settings for the Bright Novae plugin -- just make it carefully!

\begin{longtabu} to \textwidth {l|l|X}\toprule
\emph{ID}            & \emph{Type} & \emph{Description}\\\midrule
last\_update            & string & Date and time of last update\\\midrule
update\_frequency\_days & int    & Frequency of updates, in days\\\midrule
updates\_enable         & bool   & Enable updates of bright novae catalog from Internet \\\midrule
url                     & string & URL of bright novae catalog \\\bottomrule
\end{longtabu}

\subsection{Format of bright novae catalog}
\label{sec:plugins:BrightNovae:format}

To add a new nova, open a new line after line 5 and paste the following, note commas and brackets, they are important:

\begin{configfile}
"Nova designation":
{
    "name": "name of nova",
    "type": "type of nova",
    "maxMagnitude": value of maximal visual magnitude,
    "minMagnitude": value of minimal visual magnitude,
    "peakJD": JD for maximal visual magnitude,
    "m2": Time to decline by 2mag from maximum (in days),
    "m3": Time to decline by 3mag from maximum (in days),
    "m6": Time to decline by 6mag from maximum (in days),
    "m9": Time to decline by 9mag from maximum (in days),
    "distance": value of distance between nova and 
                Earth (in thousands of Light Years),
    "RA": "Right ascension (J2000)",
    "Dec": "Declination (J2000)"
},
\end{configfile}

\noindent For example, the record for \textbf{Nova Cygni 1975} (\textbf{V1500 Cyg}) looks like:
\begin{configfile}
"V1500 Cyg":
{
    "name": "Nova Cygni 1975",
    "type": "NA",
    "maxMagnitude": 1.69,
    "minMagnitude": 21,
    "peakJD": 2442655,
    "m2": 2,
    "m3": 4,
    "m6": 32,
    "m9": 263
    "distance": 6.36,
    "RA": "21h11m36.6s",
    "Dec": "48d09m02s"
},
\end{configfile}

\subsection{Light curves}
\label{sec:plugins:BrightNovae:lightcurves}

This plugin uses a very simple model for calculation of light curves for
novae stars. This model is based on time for decay by $N$
magnitudes from the maximum value, where $N$ is 2, 3, 6 and 9. If a
nova has no values for decay of magnitude then this plugin will use
generalized values for it.

\newpage

\section{Compass Marks Plugin}
\label{sec:plugins:CompassMarks}

%\url{http://porpoisehead.net/images/plugin-compass-marks.jpg}

Stellarium helps the user get their bearings using the cardinal point
feature - the North, South, East and West markers on the horizon.
Compass Marks takes this idea and extends it to add markings every few
degrees along the horizon, and includes compass bearing values in
degrees.

\subsection{Using the plugin}
\label{sec:plugins:CompassMarks:using}

There is a tool bar button for toggling the compass markings, or you can
press \key{control-C}.

Note that when you first enable compass marks, the cardinal points will
be turned off. You can have both active at once, but there is a small
bug which means you have to press \key{Q} \emph{two times} to
re-enable cardinal points after enabling the compass markings.

\newpage

\section{Equation of Time Plugin}
\label{sec:plugins:EquationOfTime}
The Equation of Time plugin shows the solution of the equation of time (Fig.~\ref{fig:EqOfTime}).

\begin{figure}[h]
\includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{EquationOfTime-plugin.jpg}
\label{fig:EqOfTime}
\caption{Interface of Equation of Time plugin}
\end{figure}

The equation of time describes the discrepancy between two kinds of solar time. These are apparent solar time, which directly tracks the motion of the sun, and mean solar time, which tracks a fictitious ``mean'' sun with noons 24 hours apart. There is no universally accepted definition of the sign of the equation of time. Some publications show it as positive when a sundial is ahead of a clock; others when the clock is ahead of the sundial. In the English-speaking world, the former usage is the more common, but is not always followed. Anyone who makes use of a published table or graph should first check its sign usage.

\subsection{Using the Equation of Time plugin}
\label{sec:plugins:EquationOfTime:using}

\begin{enumerate}
\item Enable the tool by clicking the tool-bar button ``Load at startup''.
\item Click on the Equation of Time button on the bottom toolbar for displaying solution for equation of time on top of the screen.
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Section \big[EquationOfTime\big] in config.ini file}
\label{sec:plugins:EquationOfTime:config}

You can edit \file{config.ini} file by yourself for changes of the
settings for the Equation of Time plugin -- just make it carefully!

\begin{longtabu} to \textwidth {l|l|X}\toprule
\emph{ID}            & \emph{Type} & \emph{Description}\\\midrule
enable\_at\_startup  & bool & Display solution of the equation of time at startup of the planetarium\\\midrule
flag\_use\_ms\_format & bool & Set format for the displayed solution - minutes and seconds and decimal minutes\\\midrule
flag\_use\_inverted\_value & bool & Change sign of the equation of time \\\midrule
flag\_show\_button & bool & Enable displaying plugin button on the bottom toolbar\\\midrule

\section{Exoplanets Plugin}
\label{sec:plugins:Exoplanets}
This plugin plots the position of stars with exoplanets. Exoplanets data is derived from ``The Extrasolar Planets Encyclopaedia''\footnote{\url{http://exoplanet.eu/}}. List of potential habitable exoplanets and data about them were taken from ``The Habitable Exoplanets Catalog''\footnote{\url{http://phl.upr.edu/projects/habitable-exoplanets-catalog}} by Planetary Habitability Laboratory\footnote{\url{http://phl.upr.edu/home}}.

\begin{figure}[h]
\includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{exoplanets.jpg}
\label{fig:Exoplanets}
\caption{Planetary system HD 13808}
\end{figure}

\subsection{Potential habitable exoplanets}
\label{sec:plugins:Exoplanets:habitable}
This plugin can display potential habitable exoplanets (orange marker) and some information about those planets.

\paragraph{Planetary Class}
Planet classification from host star spectral type (F, G, K, M), habitable zone (hot, warm, cold) and size (miniterran, subterran, terran, superterran, jovian, neptunian) (Earth = G-Warm Terran).

\paragraph{Equilibrium Temperature}
The planetary equilibrium temperature\footnote{\url{http://lasp.colorado.edu/~bagenal/3720/CLASS6/6EquilibriumTemp.html}} is a theoretical temperature in (\degree C) that the planet would be at when considered simply as if it were a black body being heated only by its parent star (assuming a 0.3 bond albedo). As example the planetary equilibrium temperature of Earth is -18.15\degree C (255 K).

\paragraph{Earth Similarity Index (ESI)}
Similarity to Earth\footnote{\url{http://phl.upr.edu/projects/earth-similarity-index-esi}} on a scale from 0 to 1, with 1 being the most Earth-like. ESI depends on the planet's radius, density, escape velocity, and surface temperature.

\subsection{Proper names}
\label{sec:plugins:Exoplanets:ProperNames}
In December 2015, the International Astronomical Union (IAU) has officially approved names for several exoplanets after a public vote.
\begin{itemize}

\section{Meteor Showers Plugin}
\label{sec:plugins:MeteorShowers}

This plugin displays meteor showers and a marker for each active and inactive radiant, showing real information about its activity\footnote{This plugin was created as project of ESA Summer of Code in Space 2013 -- \url{http://sophia.estec.esa.int/socis2013/?q=about}}.

\begin{figure}[h]
\includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{meteorshowers.jpg}
\label{fig:MeteorShowers}
\caption{Leonids 1833}
\end{figure}

Info about meteor showers you can get here:
\begin{itemize}
\item Meteor shower -- \url{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meteor_Showers}
\item International Meteor Organization -- \url{http://www.imo.net/}
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Terms}
\label{sec:plugins:MeteorShowers:terms}

\paragraph{Meteor shower}
A meteor shower is a celestial event in which a number of meteors are observed to radiate, or originate, from one point in the night sky. These meteors are caused by streams of cosmic debris called meteoroids entering Earth's atmosphere at extremely high speeds on parallel trajectories. Most meteors are smaller than a grain of sand, so almost all of them disintegrate and never hit the Earth's surface. Intense or unusual meteor showers are known as meteor outbursts and meteor storms, which may produce greater than 1,000 meteors an hour.

\paragraph{Radiant}

The radiant or apparent radiant of a meteor shower is the point in the sky, from which (to a planetary observer) meteors appear to originate. The Perseids, for example, are meteors which appear to come from a point within the constellation of Perseus.

An observer might see such a meteor anywhere in the sky but the direction of motion, when traced back, will point to the radiant. A meteor that does not point back to the known radiant for a given shower is known as a sporadic and is not considered part of that shower.

Many showers have a radiant point that changes position during the interval when it appears. For example, the radiant point for the Delta Aurigids drifts by more than a degree per night.

\paragraph{Zenithal Hourly Rate (ZHR)}

In astronomy, the Zenithal Hourly Rate (ZHR) of a meteor shower is the number of meteors a single observer would see in one hour under a clear, dark sky (limiting apparent magnitude of 6.5) if the radiant of the shower were at the zenith. The rate that can effectively be seen is nearly always lower and decreases the closer the radiant is to the horizon.

\paragraph{Population index}

The population index indicates the magnitude distribution of the meteor showers. The values below 2.5 correspond to distributions where bright meteors are more frequent than average, while values above 3.0 mean that the share of faint meteors is larger than usual.

\subsection{Enabling Meteor Showers plugin}
\label{sec:plugins:MeteorShowers:using}

\begin{enumerate}
\item Open the configuration window (F2)
\item Click on the plugins tab

\section{Text User Interface}
\label{sec:plugins:TextUserInterface}

%\url{http://porpoisehead.net/images/plugin-tui.jpg}

Older versions of Stellarium used to have a little menu system which was
controlled by the cursor keys. This was used primarily by planetarium
system operators to change settings, run scripts and so on. In the
0.10.x series, this function vanished as we totally re-designed the user
interface. This plugin re-implements the ``TUI'', as it was known. Full
list of the commands for the TUI plugin you can read in the section
\href{TUI_Commands}{TUI Commands}.

\subsection{Using the Text User Interface}
\label{sec:plugins:TUI:using}

\begin{enumerate}
\item Activate the text menu using the \key{Alt-T} key.\footnote{This
    used to be hard-coded to \key{M} before version 0.15, but
    \key{Alt-T} runs parallel with \key{Ctrl-T} for switching the GUI
    panels, and frees up \key{M} for the Milky Way. The \key{Alt-T}
    keybinding is hardcoded, i.e., cannot be reconfigured by the
    user.}
\item
  Navigate the menu using the cursors keys.
\item
  To edit a value, press the right cursor until the value you wish to
  change it highlighted with \textgreater{} and \textless{} marks, e.g.\
  \textgreater{}3.142\textless{}. Then press the up and down cursors to
  change the value. You may also type in a new value with the other keys
  on the keyboard.
\end{enumerate}

5.13 & Ecliptic Line   & Changes the colour of the ecliptic line\\\midrule
5.14 & Nebula Names    & Changes the colour of the labels for nebulae\\\midrule
5.15 & Nebula Circles  & Changes the colour of the circles used to denote the positions of nebulae (only when enabled int he configuration file, note this feature is off by default)\\\midrule
6   & Effects & (menu group)\\\midrule
6.1 & Light Pollution Luminance & Changes the intensity of the light pollution simulation\\\midrule
6.2 & Landscape & Used to select the landscape which Stellarium draws when ground drawing is enabled\\\midrule
6.3 & Manual zoom & Changes the behaviour of the \key{/} and \key{\textbackslash{}} keys. When set to ``No'', these keys zoom all the way to a level defined
by object type (auto zoom mode). When set to ``Yes'', these keys zoom in and out a smaller amount and multiple presses are required\\\midrule
6.4 & Object Sizing Rule & When set to ``Magnitude'', stars are drawn with a size based on their apparent magnitude. When set to ``Point'' all stars are drawn with the same size on the screen\\\midrule
6.5 & Magnitude Sizing Multiplier & Changes the size of the stars when ``Object Sizing Rule'' is set to ``Magnitude''\\\midrule
6.6 & Milky Way intensity & Changes the brightness of the Milky Way texture\\\midrule
6.7 & Maximum Nebula Magnitude to Label & Changes the magnitude limit for labelling of nebulae\\\midrule
6.8 & Zoom Duration & Sets the time for zoom operations to take (in seconds)\\\midrule
6.9 & Cursor Timeout & Sets the number of seconds of mouse inactivity before the cursor vanishes\\\midrule
6.10 & Setting Landscape Sets Location & If ``Yes'' then changing the landscape will move the observer location to the location for that landscape (if one is known). 
                                         Setting this to ``No'' means the observer location is not modified when the landscape is changed.\\\midrule
7 & Scripts & (menu group)\\\midrule
7.1 & Local Script & Run a script from the scripts sub-directory of the User Directory or Installation Directory (see section~\ref{sec:FilesAndDirectories} (Files and Directories))\\\midrule
7.2 & CD/DVD Script          & Run a script from a CD or DVD (only used in planetarium set-ups)\\\midrule
8   & Administration         & (menu group)\\\midrule
8.1 & Load Default Configuration & Reset all settings according to the main configuration file\\\midrule
8.2 & Save Current Configuration as Default & Save the current settings to the main configuration file\\\midrule
8.3 & Shutdown               & Quit Stellarium\\\midrule
8.4 & Update me via Internet & Only used in planetarium set-ups\\\midrule
8.5 & Set UI Locale          & Change the language used for the user interface\\\bottomrule
