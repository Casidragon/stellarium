\chapter{Interface Guide}
\label{ch:interface}

The way stellarium is shown on the screen is primarily governed by the
menus. These are accessed by dragging the mouse to the left or bottom
edge of the screen, where the menus will slide out.

\section{Tour}
\label{sec:interface:tour}

\begin{figure}[tbh]\centering
\includegraphics[width=0.6\textwidth]{001}
\caption{Stellarium main view. (Combination of day and night views.)}
\label{fig:001}
\end{figure}

At the bottom left of the screen, you can see the status bar. This shows
the current observer location, field of view (FOV), graphics performance
in frames per second (FPS) and the current simulation date and time.

The rest of the view is devoted to rendering a realistic scene including
a panoramic landscape and the sky. If the simulation time and observer
location are such that it is night time, you will see stars, planets and
the moon in the sky, all in the correct positions.

You can drag with the mouse on the sky to look around or use the cursor
keys. You can zoom with the mouse wheel or the page up/page down keys.

Much of Stellarium can be controlled very intuitively with the
mouse. Many settings can additionally be switched with
hotkeys. We will present the default hotkeys in this guide. However,
hotkeys can be reconfigured to match your taste
(See~\ref{sec:Hotkeys}).

If you move the mouse over the status bar, it will move up to reveal a
tool bar which gives quick control over the program.

\subsection{Time Travel}
\label{sec:interface:timeTravel}

When Stellarium starts up, it sets its clock to the same time and date
as the system clock. However, Stellarium's clock is not fixed to same
time and date as the system clock, or indeed to the same speed. We may
tell Stellarium to change how fast time should pass, and even make time
go backwards! So the first thing we shall do is to travel into the
future! Let's take a look at the time control buttons on the right hand
ride of the tool-bar. If you hover the mouse cursor over the buttons, a
short description of the button's purpose and keyboard shortcut will
appear.\footnote{Unfortunately, on Windows~7 and later, with NVidia and AMD GPUs, these tooltips often do not work.}

\begin{table}[h]
\centering
\begin{tabular}{c c l}\toprule
\emph{Button} & \emph{Shortcut key} & \emph{Description}\\\midrule
\includegraphics[scale=0.75]{timerate_decrease} & \key{J} & Decrease the rate at which time passes \\
\includegraphics[scale=0.75]{timerate_normal}   & \key{K} & Make time pass as normal \\
\includegraphics[scale=0.75]{timerate_increase} & \key{L} & Increase the rate at which time passes \\
\includegraphics[scale=0.75]{time_normal}       & \key{8} & Return to the current time \& date \\
\bottomrule
\end{tabular}
\caption{Time Travel}
\end{table}

OK, so lets go see the future! Click the mouse once on the increase time
speed button \includegraphics[scale=0.5]{timerate_increase}. 
Not a whole lot seems to happen. However, take a look at the clock in
the status bar. You should see the time going by faster than a normal
clock! Click the button a second time. Now the time is going by faster
than before. If it's night time, you might also notice that the stars
have started to move slightly across the sky. If it's daytime you might
be able to see the sun moving (but it's less apparent than the movement
of the stars). Increase the rate at which time passes again by clicking
on the button a third time. Now time is really flying!

Let time move on at this fast speed for a little while. Notice how the
stars move across the sky. If you wait a little while, you'll see the
Sun rising and setting. It's a bit like a time-lapse movie. 

Stellarium not only allows for moving forward through time -- you can
go backwards too! Click on the real time speed button
\includegraphics[scale=0.5]{timerate_normal}.  The stars and/or the
Sun should stop scooting across the sky. Now press the decrease time
speed button \includegraphics[scale=0.5]{timerate_decrease} once. Look
at the clock. Time has stopped. Click the Decrease time speed button
four or five more times. Now we're falling back through time at quite
a rate (about one day every ten seconds!).

Enough time travel for now. Wait until it's night time, and then click
the Real time speed button. With a little luck you will now be looking
at the night sky.

\subsection{Moving Around the Sky}
\label{sec:interface:moving}

\begin{table}[h]
\centering
\begin{tabular}{ll}\toprule
\emph{Key}          & \emph{Description}\\\midrule
Cursor keys         & Pan the view left, right, up and down \\
Page up / Page down & Zoom in and out \\
Backslash (\key{\textbackslash{}}) & Auto-zoom out to original field of view \\
Left mouse button                  & Select an object in the sky \\
Right mouse button                 & Clear selected object \\
Mouse wheel                        & Zoom in and out \\ 
\key{Space}                        & Centre view on selected object \\
Forward-slash (\key{/})            & Auto-zoom in to selected object \\
\bottomrule
\end{tabular}
\caption{Moving Around the Sky}
\label{tab:interface:moving}
\end{table}

As well as travelling through time, Stellarium lets to look around the
sky freely, and zoom in and out. There are several ways to accomplish
this listed in table~\ref{tab:interface:moving}.

Let's try it. Use the cursors to move around left, right, up and down.
Zoom in a little using the \key{Page Up} key, and back out again using the
\key{Page Down}. Press the \key{\textbackslash} key and see how Stellarium returns to the
original field of view (how ``zoomed in'' the view is), and direction of
view.
%% TODO Is this still original behaviour? On German Kbd, this does not work anyways, backslash is a AltGr-combination.

It's also possible to move around using the mouse. If you left-click and
drag somewhere on the sky, you can pull the view around.

Another method of moving is to select some object in the sky (left-click
on the object), and press the \key{Space} key to centre the view on that
object. Similarly, selecting an object and pressing the forward-slash
key \key{/} will centre on the object and zoom right in on it.

The forward-slash \key{/} and backslash \key{\textbackslash} keys auto-zoom in an out to different
zoom levels depending on what is selected. If the object selected is a planet
or moon in a \emph{sub-system} with a lot of moons (e.g.\ Jupiter), the
initial zoom in will go to an intermediate level where the whole
sub-system should be visible. A second zoom will go to the full zoom
level on the selected object. Similarly, if you are fully zoomed in on a
moon of Jupiter, the first auto-zoom out will go to the sub-system zoom
level. Subsequent auto-zoom out will fully zoom out and return the
initial direction of view. For objects that are not part of a
sub-system, the initial auto-zoom in will zoom right in on the selected
object (the exact field of view depending on the size/type of the
selected object), and the initial auto-zoom out will return to the
initial FOV and direction of view.

\subsection{Main Tool-bar}
\label{sec:interface:toolbar}

\begin{figure}[htb]
\centering\includegraphics[width=0.6\textwidth]{002}
\caption{Night scene with constellation artwork and moon.}
\label{fig:002}
\end{figure}

Stellarium can do a whole lot more than just draw the stars. Figure~\ref{fig:002}
shows some of Stellarium's visual effects including constellation
line and boundary drawing, constellation art, planet hints, and
atmospheric halo around the bright Moon. The controls in the main tool-bar
provide a mechanism for turning on and off the visual effects.

When the mouse if moved to the bottom left of the screen, a second
tool-bar becomes visible. All the buttons in this side tool-bar open
and close dialog boxes which contain controls for further
configuration of the program. \newFeature{0.15} You can drag the
windows around, and the position will be used again when you restart
Stellarium. If this would mean the window is off-screen (because you
start in windowed mode, or with a different screen), the window will
be moved so that at least a part is visible.

Table~\ref{tab:interface:buttons} describes the operations of buttons
on the main tool-bar and the side tool-bar, and gives their default
keyboard shortcuts.

\subsection{The Object Search Window}
\label{sec:interface:search}

\begin{figure}[h]
\centering\includegraphics{search_dialog}
\caption{The Object Search Window}
\label{fig:interface:search}
\end{figure}

The Object Search window provides a convenient way to locate objects in
the sky. Simply type in the name of an object to find, and then click
the \button{go} button or press \key{return}. Stellarium will point you at that
object in the sky.

As you type, Stellarium will make a list of objects which begin with
what you have typed so far. The first of the list of matching objects
will be highlighted. If you press the \key{TAB} key, the selection will change
to the next item in the list. Hitting the \key{RETURN} key will go to the
currently highlighted object and close the search dialog.

For example, suppose we want to locate Mimas (a moon of Saturn). After
typing the first letter of the name, \emph{m}, Stellarium makes a list
of objects whose name begins with M: Mars, Mercury, Mimas, Miranda,
Moon. The first item in this list, Mars, is highlighted. Pressing \key{return}
now would go to Mars, but we want Mimas. We can either press \key{TAB} twice
to highlight Mimas and then hit \key{RETURN}, or we can continue to type the
name until it is the first/only object in the list.

\begin{figure}[h]
\centering\includegraphics{search_dialog_position}
\caption{The Search Window: Positions}
\label{fig:interface:search:position}
\end{figure}

The Position tab provides a convenient way to enter a user set
of coordinates.

\begin{figure}[h]
\centering\includegraphics{search_dialog_option}
\caption{The Search Window: Options}
\label{fig:interface:search:options}
\end{figure}

The Options tab provides a few settings to fine-tune your search experience.
When the name of an object to find is typed in the object
window and you are connected to the internet and ``Extend search'' is
ticked, Stellarium will search the SIMBAD on-line  data bases for its
coordinates. You can then click the \button{go} button or press return.
Stellarium will point you at that object in the sky even if there is no
object displayed on the screen. The SIMBAD server being used can be
selected from the scroll window.

\begin{figure}[h]
\centering\includegraphics{search_dialog_list}
\caption{The Search Window: Lists}
\label{fig:interface:search:position}
\end{figure}

The List Search tab allows selection of an object from predefined
sets.  The number of choices is governed by the loaded plug
ins. Simply scroll down the first window to select the type. The name
of an object can then be selected from the list. Press \key{enter} and
stelarium will go to that object.

\subsection{Help Window}
\index{sec:interface:help}

\begin{figure}[h]
\centering\includegraphics{help_dialog}
\caption{Help Window}
\label{fig:interface:help}
\end{figure}

The Help window lists all of Stellarium's key-strokes. Note that some
features are only available as key strokes, so it's a good idea to have
a browse of the information in this window.

\begin{figure}[h]
\centering\includegraphics{help_dialog_about}
%\caption{Help Window}
\caption{Help Window: About}
\label{fig:interface:help:about}
\end{figure}

The About tab in this window will show licensing information, and a list
of people who helped to produce the program.

\begin{figure}[h]
\centering\includegraphics{help_dialog_log}
%\caption{Help Window}
\caption{Help Window: Logfile}
\label{fig:interface:help:log}
\end{figure}

The help window log tab shows the loading instructions carried out when
stellarium runs. It is useful to locate the files that stellarium writes
to your computer. The same information is written to  the file \file{log.txt} that you will
find in your user area (see~\ref{sec:Directories}).

\section{Taking Screenshots}
\label{sec:interface:screenshots}

You can save what is on the screen to a file by pressing
\textbf{Control-S}. Screenshots are taken in \file{.png} format, and
have filenames something like this: \file{stellarium-000.png},
\file{stellarium-001.png} (the number increments to prevent
over-writing existing files).

Stellarium creates screenshots in a directory depending on
your system type, see section
\ref{sec:Directories} Files and Directories.




\section{Visual Effects}
\label{ch:VisualEffects}

%% GZ TODO This is the only section here? Bortle table moved to References Appendix, and this chapter may be removed.

\subsection{Light Pollution}
\label{sec:LightPollution}

Stellarium can simulate light pollution, which is controlled from the
light pollution section of the \emph{Sky} tab of the \emph{View} window.
Light pollution levels are set using a numerical value between 1 and 9
which corresponds to the \emph{Bortle Dark Sky Scale} (see Appendix~\ref{ch:BortleScale}).
