<h3>Usage Notes</h3>
<h4>Virtual Telescope</h4>
<p>The <i>Stellarium Virtual Telescope</i> option that can be selected in the <em>Device model</em> list simulates the behaviour of a telescope controlled by Stellarium without actually controlling a real one. The <em>Serial port</em> field remains active, but its value is ignored. This option is equivalent to the <em>Dummy</em> telescope type supported by Stellarium's original telescope control feature.</p>
<h4>Custom serial port names</h4>
<p>New entries can be typed in the <em>Serial port</em> list if it does not contain a suitable value. This is the only way to select a serial port in the Mac OS X version.</p>
<h4>Telescope server executables</h4>
<p>This plug-in can use Stellarium's stand-alone telescope servers/drivers to override the built-in telescope control code.</p>
<p>Telescope server executable files should be placed in a directory called <em>servers</em> in Stellarium's installation directory, its user data directory, or in the directory specified in the Options tab.</p>
