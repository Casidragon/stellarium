2011-07-28: material groups: If objects appear with bad texture
coordinates, prepend "usemtl <material_name>" with a line "g
<material_name>"

This happens for OBJs exported from Meshlab!


To fix for now:

awk '/usemat / {print "g ", $2; print }; !/usemat / {print}' file.obj > file_fixed.obj

This should be repaired in the loader, obviously!

TODO:

1) shadow mapping. A partial solution has been implemented, but needs
   improvements or a rewrite. Light sources to consider are obviously
   the sun, at nighttimes the moon, and without any of the two, the
   planet Venus. Only 1 shadowing lightsource is active.

2) Higher quality OBJ models may include bump or normal maps for added
   realism. Add support for those, i.e. implement more OBJ tags. 
   NURBS are still not required.

3) Rendering models with more than ~300.000 triangles can be too slow for meaningful use.
   Any speed-up of the model rendering welcome!

4) A switchable ambient illumination to illuminate the foreground
   scenery. A "cool" effect like a torch ("Fackel") or campfire would
   be nice "eye-candy", if easily implemented.
