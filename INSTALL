-------------------- STELLARIUM INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS ---------------------

===============================================================================
                           BINARY INSTALLATION
===============================================================================
Most users will prefer using precompiled binary packages:

- WINDOWS USERS :
run setup.exe and follow the instructions.

- MACOSX USERS :
run stellarium.dmg

- LINUX USERS :
Look for the binary package matching your distribution.


===============================================================================
        COMPILATION from the source package (stellarium-XXX.tgz)
===============================================================================
If you can't find a suited binary package or if you are curious you can also 
compile the software by yourself.

Make sure you install all the necessary dependencies. See this wiki page:

http://stellarium.org/wiki/index.php/Build_Dependencies

Once they are installed you are ready to compile Stellarium sources:

Untar the tar.gz archive:
~$ tar -xzf stellarium-XXX.tar.gz
~$ cd stellarium

Then type:
~$ ./configure
~$ make

Then to launch the local version of the program type:
~$ ./src/stellarium

To fully install Stellarium (so that it will be launch-able from everywhere) 
type as root:
~$ make install

Once installed you may want to clean the build directory:
~$ make clean

If you want to uninstall Stellarium, type as root:
~$ make uninstall

===============================================================================
Special instructions for COMPILATION on WINDOWS (XP) with MinGW
===============================================================================

See the wiki:
http://stellarium.org/wiki/index.php/Windows_Build_Instructions


===============================================================================
              COMPILATION (and modification) from the SVN sources
===============================================================================
You can get the latest SVN snapshot (from sourceforge). However with this SVN
version no correct behaviour is guaranteed. It is mainly intended for use by
developers. 
You can browse the SVN tree from 

http://stellarium.svn.sourceforge.net/viewvc/stellarium/

For build instructions see these pages on the Stellarium wiki:

http://stellarium.org/wiki/index.php/Compilation_on_Linux
http://stellarium.org/wiki/index.php/Windows_Build_Instructions
http://stellarium.org/wiki/index.php/Building_universal_Stellarium_0.8.1_on_an_Intel_Mac


You can have a look at the src/ directory where you will find the source 
files.  Edit whatever you want in it and when your new great feature is done 
you will need to share it with the community of Stellarium developers.

At this point, an official developer just have to type svn commit to update 
the repository version. But as you are not an official developer (yet!) you 
will need to create a patch file which will contain all the changes you did 
on the source code.  

~$ cd directory-you-want-to-diff
~$ svn diff > mypatch.diff

You can now submit mypatch.diff on the sourceforge Stellarium page in the 
patches section (http://sourceforge.net/tracker/?group_id=48857&atid=454375) 
with a clear comment on what is the patch doing.

A project member will then have a look at it and decide whether the patch is 
accepted or rejected for integration into Stellarium.
