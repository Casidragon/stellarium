# GCVS part for Stellarium. This file contains part of Hipparcos stars from GCVS.
# Format:
# + One record per line
# + Fields in a record are delimited with the tab character
# + Line beginning with a # character are comments
# + Field are as follows:
#   - HIP
#   - GCVS designation
#   - Type of variability
#   - Magnitude at maximum brightness
#   - Minimal magnitude flag code (0=No flag, 1="<" if magMax is a bright limit, 
#                                  2="(" if magMax is an amplitude,
#                                  3=">" if magMax is a faint limit)
#   - Minimum magnitude or amplitude
#   - The photometric system for magnitudes (0=V, 1=Hp, 2=B, 3=U, 4=p, 5=K, 6=Y )
#   - Epoch for maximum light (Julian days)
#   - Period of the variable star (days)
#   - Rising time or duration of eclipse (%)
#   - Spectral type
