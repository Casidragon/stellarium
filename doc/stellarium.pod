stellarium - A real-time realistic planetarium

=head1 SYNOPSIS

stellarium [options]

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Stellarium is a free GPL software which renders realistic skies in real
time with OpenGL. It is available for Linux/Unix, Windows and MacOSX.
With Stellarium, you really see what you can see with your eyes, 
binoculars or a small telescope.

Specify the initial observer altitude, where I<alt> is the altitude in 
meters.

=item B<--longitude> I<lon>
