# Todo list for Stellarium 0.8
# 

### Bugs

- Selected object flashes on windows when tracking
- Does gettext work on windows now?


### Non-code enhancements

- more nebulae
- more landscapes
- more translations
- minor planets
- more natural satelites
- more documentation


### Cleanup

- Move object attributes out of globals and into the objects
- Move version number out of logo image
- stop using glpng and use SDL_image or similar


## Features for 0.8.0

T select location by city
T search text area should get focus when bring up search window
- GUI access to set sky language and sky culture (ideally with new pulldown menu)
R sidereal day/week key control 
- limiting magnitude/simulate light pollution
T alt/az readout for selected object
- unicode font support (need to choose solution)
T error message windows as option to be easier for windows users (script errors in particular)
R mouse cursor hide after timeout as option
R limiting mag for nebulae set in TUI
R constellation line color set in TUI
R remove planet orbits from 'p' key - move to another key and TUI
R set zoom location
- precession circle drawing
- meridian line (first press of 'z')
T hour angle on equator line (already on equatorial grid)
- ecliptic line with (localized) months labeled
- script display text command
- i18n nebulae labels
T object name pick option (show only label/hint for selected object)


### Future feature ideas

T chart/print option
- select multiple constellations at once (for scripts)
T select zodiac constellations somehow
- planet rotational position issues - only galilean  moons accurate
- comets
- orbit algorithm degeneration issue beyond =/- 10k years 
- script meteor radiant
T constellation boundaries
- object distances besides stars
- proper motion of stars (after fix orbits over time issue)
- star trails/time exposure
- script images in dome alt-az coords
- script images in equatorial coords
- font scales?
- planet trails of longer duration (script?)
- background audio option
- scripts allow user interaction during playback option?
- Reduce the program size by reducing the stellplanet library size, especially the moon coefficents file?
- Artificial satellites
- Aurorae
- telescope control???
