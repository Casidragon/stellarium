Stellarium TODO list :

Please help me continuing this program

Known bugs :
* Moon position is quite unaccurate.
* Very big zooming makes objects "shaky" : arithmetic precision?
* On unix, configuration files might conflict between versions.

Important features :
* A way to enter exact time from within the program.
    - need the implementation of the widget "edit" in gui.
* Selection of any object available in a list.
    - need the implementation of the widget "list" in gui.

Other cool features :
* A popup with the photo of the selected object
* Shooting star and meteor shower
* Northern Lights
* Re-program the planet class using other libraries who give the axe of the planet in the ecliptique plane, the position in the rotation, extension with jupiter and saturn satellites, other planets, etc...
* Using real 3D landscape of every region in the world with data taken from the site http://www.megginson.com/flightsim/fgfs-vmap0/
