# Todo list for Stellarium 0.8
# 

### Bugs

- Selected object flashes on windows when tracking
- Does gettext work on windows now? - DONE
- Is Windows locale mapped to gettext locale on windows?
- No daylight savings correction on Windows
- Date display wrong for negative JD dates

### Non-code enhancements

- more nebulae
- more landscapes
- more translations
- minor planets
- more natural satellites
- more documentation
- constellation art for other cultures
- We should consider using rosetta for translators (https://launchpad.net/rosetta)

### Cleanup

- Move object attributes out of globals and into the objects
- Move version number out of logo image
- stop using glpng and use SDL_image or similar.
- Split stel_core+stel_sdl class into a real independant core managing sky rendering only and a stel_app class which manage GUI, I/O etc... This may include a reorganization of the src file structure itself.
- Separate all s_gui code into an independant library.
- Replace all translatable char* and c++ string by w_char* and c++ wstring for unicode support
- Think on a way to include plug-ins for telescope control etc..
- Why does each object have it's own font object?  What about sharing one per font to save memory?
 > because each has a different size, the openGL needs a list for each size.

## Features for 0.8.0

T select location by city - DONE
T search text area should get focus when bring up search window - DONE
- GUI access to set sky language and sky culture (ideally with new pulldown menu)
R sidereal day/week key control 
- limiting magnitude/simulate light pollution (the feature somehow already exists in the skybright class BASIC version)
- alt/az readout for selected object
- unicode font support (need to choose solution between glgooey/FTGL/our own implemenation)
  > ftgl looks good
- error message windows as option to be easier for windows users (script errors in particular)
R mouse cursor hide after timeout as option - DONE
R limiting mag for nebulae labels set in TUI - DONE
R constellation line color set in TUI - DONE
R remove planet orbits from 'p' key - move to another key and TUI
R set zoom location
- precession circle drawing
R meridian line (first press of 'z') - DONE
- hour angle on equator line (already on equatorial grid)
- ecliptic line with (localized) months labeled
- script display text command
- i18n nebulae labels
- object name pick option (show only label/hint for selected object)
F cylindrical projection mode.
T Night vision mode (red Gui) - DONE <-- Need more descriptive flag names (like night_vision_ui instead of night) R
- Create a directory dedicated to landscapes with one landscapeXX.ini per landscape so that users can install extra landscapes just be copying them there without editing landscape.ini file.
- other star catalogs incl double stars and variable stars

### Future feature ideas

- Constellation boundaries.
T chart option
- print option (We should think about a real postscript/pdf renderer for printing)
- select multiple constellations at once (for scripts)
T select zodiac constellations somehow
- planet rotational position issues - only galilean  moons accurate
- comets
- orbit algorithm degeneration issue beyond =/- 10k years 
- script meteor radiant
T constellation boundaries
- object distances besides stars
- proper motion of stars (after fix orbits over time issue)
- star trails/time exposure
- script images in dome alt-az coords
- script images in equatorial coords
- outline fonts
- planet trails of longer duration (script?)
- background audio option
- scripts allow user interaction during playback option?
- Reduce the program size by reducing the stellplanet library size, especially the moon coefficents file?
- Artificial satellites
- Aurorae
- Clouds
- telescope control
- Use libjpeg for some texture to reduce data files size
- Use 3D landscapes (data from google earth?)
