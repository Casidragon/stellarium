In one month i will graduate from my university! I am therefore looking for a real job. If you need a good engineer for a scientific job, I am interested. I'm even more interested if you are located in Finland. Please have a look at my resume, and (hopefully!) contact me.

It's now 2 months I'm working on a new version of stellarium. A lot of big improvements are on construction : I totally reorganized old part of the sources in a good object oriented way. I use now new algorithms for planets positions calculation and astronomical operations. The precision is really improved and sun eclipses, mercury transit are now visible. Jupiter satellites are here (beta) and i created a new faster and better atmosphere algorithm. This next version will hopefully be released in a few weeks!!

I try to integrate more and more the project management with sourceforge. Please don't send reports anymore directly to my Email adress, see the section bug reports and feature requests for such things. The final goal is to enable new team members to join the project by making the informations available to everybody.

Stellarium is curently in active development, and soon will be released a new "reorganized" version with global improvement of astronomical precision (eclipses etc...), simplification of the source code for a better future improvements. Please be patient!
