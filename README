--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1. INTRODUCTION
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Stellarium is a free software available for Windows, Linux/Unix and MacOSX. It
renders 3D photo-realistic skies in real time.
With stellarium, you really see what you can see with your eyes, binoculars or
a small telescope.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
2. INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Please see the INSTALL file.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
3. REQUIREMENT
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Windows or linux/POSIX or CYGWIN or MACOSX environement
A 3d openGL acceleration card and a good CPU.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
4. QUICK START
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Navigation :
Use the direction keys to move the point of view.
Use page up and page down keys to zoom in and out.
Use left mouse button to select an object, right button to select no object and
middle mouse button or SPACE to center on the selected object.
Zooming on nebulas or planets is very interesting....
Use J, K and L to increment/decrement time speed.
Press the H key for more help.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
5. CONFIGURATION
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
From version 0.6.0 the most useful configuration options can be set from within
the program.
You can however change it by hand in the file located in config/config.txt and
config/location.txt on Windows/MacOSX and are located in $HOME/.stellarium/
on a unix system.

	1.1 The tone reproductor class
		The class mainly performs a fast implementation of the algorithm from
		the	paper [1], with more accurate values from [2]. The blue shift
		formula is taken from [3] and combined with the Scotopic vision
		formula from [4].

		The class is a fast reimplementation of the VISLIMIT.BAS basic source
		code from Brad Schaefer's article on pages 57-60,  May 1998 _Sky &
		Telescope_,	"To the Visual Limits". The basic sources are available on
		the Sky and Telescope web site.
