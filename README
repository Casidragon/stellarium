--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1. INTRODUCTION
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Stellarium is a free software available for Windows, Linux/Unix and MacOSX. It
renders 3D photo-realistic skies in real time.
With stellarium, you really see what you can see with your eyes, binoculars or
a small telescope.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
2. INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Please see the INSTALL file.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
3. REQUIREMENT
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Windows or linux/POSIX or CYGWIN or MACOSX environement
A 3d openGL acceleration card and a good CPU.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
4. QUICK START
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Navigation :
Use the direction keys to move the point of view.
Use page up and page down keys to zoom in and out.
Use left mouse button to select an object, right button to select no object and
middle mouse button or SPACE to center on the selected object.
Zooming on nebulas or planets is very interesting....
Use J, K and L to increment/decrement time speed.
Press the H key for more help.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
5. CONFIGURATION
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
From version 0.6.0 the most useful configuration options can be set from within
the program.
You can however change it by hand in the file located in config/config.ini on
Windows/MacOSX and in $HOME/.stellarium/ on a unix system.

6. THANKS
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

	Special thanks to Rob Spearman (Digitalis Education) for his help and
	financial support. Have a look at http://digitaliseducation.com if you
	want to buy a planetarium projector running stellarium!

	Axel Mellinger who gave me the authorisation to use his impressive
	    milky way panorama.
	Jesse Jones for his callback library.
	The celestia project team from which I borrowed many code parts.
	The libnova team for their planet calculation algorithms.
	All the SDL team for their remarquable work.
	All the sourceforge team for hosting my project.
	Cédric Delfosse for his precious help on debian port.
	The GEPI team from the Observatoire Astronomique de Paris for 
		the great Hipparcos catalog.
    Brad Schaefer for his sky rendering algorithm.
    Sylvain Ferey for his optimisation of the grids drawing.
    Ben Wyatt (ben (at) wyatt100.freeserve.co.uk) for the Glpng library.
    Jean-François Tremblay for his porting on MacOSX.
	Vincent Caron for his parser bugfix and Linux compatibility bugfixes.
	Nick Porcino for his planet function.
    Tangui Morlier for his help on Linux System.
	Bill Gray (projectpluto.com) and Mark Huss (mark (at) mhuss.com) for all
	    the astro libraries.
    Chris Laurel (claurel (at) shatters.net) who makes Celestia.
	Yuuki Ninomiya (gm (at) debian.or.jp) for the parsecfg file.

	And... All the people who sent me mails and bug reports!

	1.1 The tone reproductor class
		The class mainly performs a fast implementation of the algorithm from
		the	paper [1], with more accurate values from [2]. The blue shift
		formula is taken from [3] and combined with the Scotopic vision
		formula from [4].
