Stellarium comes with ABSOLUTELY NO WARRANTY.  See the gpl.txt 
file for details.

-----------------------------------------------------------------
INTRODUCTION
-----------------------------------------------------------------
Stellarium is a free software available for Windows, Linux/Unix 
and MacOSX. It renders 3D photo-realistic skies in real time. 
With stellarium, you really see what you can see with your eyes, 
binoculars or a small telescope.

-----------------------------------------------------------------
REQUIREMENT
-----------------------------------------------------------------
Windows or linux/POSIX or CYGWIN or MACOSX environement
A 3d openGL acceleration card and a good CPU.

-----------------------------------------------------------------
QUICK START
-----------------------------------------------------------------
Navigation :
Use the direction keys to move the point of view.
Use page up and page down keys to zoom in and out.
Use left mouse button to select an object, right button to select
no object and middle mouse button or SPACE to center on the 
selected object.
Zooming on nebulas or planets is very interesting....
Use J, K and L to increment/decrement time speed.
Press the H key for more help.

-----------------------------------------------------------------
CONFIGURATION
-----------------------------------------------------------------
Use the configurations files to change the video settings and other 
parameters. These files are located in config/config.txt and 
config/location.txt on Windows/MacOSX and are located in $HOME/.stellarium/
on a unix system.

Speed configuration :
If the FPS rate (number of Frame Per Second) is too low (<3), you probably have
no 3D acceleration. Delete the file "config.txt" and rename the file 
"config_no_3D_acceleration.txt" in "config.txt". It should be a bit faster,
but with less options.

INSTALLATION INSTUCTIONS

# The tone reproductor class :
   The class mainly performs a fast implementation of the algorithm from the
   paper [1], with more accurate values from [2]. The blue shift formula is taken
   from [3] and combined with the Scotopic vision formula from [4].
