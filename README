1. INTRODUCTION
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Stellarium is a free GPL software which renders realistic skies in real time 
with openGL. It is available for Linux/Unix, Windows and MacOSX. With Stellarium,
you really see what you can see with your eyes, binoculars or a small telescope.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
2. INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Please see the INSTALL file.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
3. REQUIREMENT
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Windows or linux/POSIX or CYGWIN or MACOSX environment
A 3d openGL acceleration card and a good CPU.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
4. QUICK START
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Navigation :
Use the direction keys or drag with the mouse to move the point of view.
Use page up and page down keys or mouse wheel to zoom in and out.
Use left mouse button to select an object, right button to select no object and
middle mouse button or SPACE to center on the selected object.
Zooming on nebulas or planets is very interesting....
Use J, K and L to increment/decrement time speed.
Press the H key for more help.

More help can be found on www.stellarium.org, and in the user guide.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
5. CONFIGURATION
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
From version 0.6.0 the most useful configuration options can be set from within
the program.
You can however change it by hand in the file located in config/config.ini on
Windows/MacOSX and in $HOME/.stellarium/ on a unix system.

1. Technical Articles
	1.1 The tone reproductor class
		The class mainly performs a fast implementation of the algorithm from
		the	paper [1], with more accurate values from [2]. The blue shift
		formula is taken from [3] and combined with the Scotopic vision
		formula from [4].

	1.2 The skylight class
		The class is a fast implementation of the algorithm from the article
		"A Practical Analytic Model for Daylight" by A. J. Preetham, Peter
		Shirley and Brian Smits.
	1.3 The skybright class
		The class is a fast reimplementation of the VISLIMIT.BAS basic source
		code from Brad Schaefer's article on pages 57-60,  May 1998 _Sky &
		Telescope_,	"To the Visual Limits". The basic sources are available on
		the Sky and Telescope web site.

	3.1 The Hipparcos star catalog
		From ESA (European Space Agency) and the Hipparcos mission.

		http://cdsweb.u-strasbg.fr/ftp/cats/I/239

		Instituto de Astrofisica de Canarias
	3.6 The Tycho-2 Catalogue of the 2.5 Million Brightest Stars

		<Astron. Astrophys. 355, L27 (2000)>

	3.7 Naval Observatory Merged Astrometric Dataset (NOMAD) version 1
		http://www.nofs.navy.mil/nomad
		Norbert Zacharias writes:
		"There are no fees, both UCAC and NOMAD are freely available
		with the only requirement that the source of the data
		(U.S. Naval Observatory) and original product name need to be
		provided with any distribution, as well as a description about
		any changes made to the data, if at all."
		The changes made to the data are:
		-) try to compute magnitude and color from the b,v,r values
		-) compute nr_of_measurements = the number of valid b,v,r values
		-) throw away or keep stars (depending on magnitude,
		   nr_of_measurements, combination of flags, tycho2 number)
		-) add all stars from hiparcos and tycho2+1st supplement
		-) reorganize the stars in several brigthness levels and triangular
		   zones according to position and magnitude
		The program that is used to generate the star files is called
		"MakeCombinedCatalogue" and can be found in the util subdirectory
		in source code.
		The position, magnitudes, and proper motions of the stars
		coming from NOMAD are unchanged, except for a possible
		loss of precision, especially in magnitude. Also proper motions of
		faint stars are neglected at all.
