<h2>Korean</h2>
<h3>Origin</h3>
<p>The Chinese, Korean, and Japanese constellations have the same origin, for they look very similar in shape, the positions and their names are the same in the chinese alphabet. The name of these constellations first appear in the Records of the Grand Historian(史記) in Han dynasty describing Xia dynasty in about B.C.2000.
<ul>
<li>China has the first starmap of the whole sky still remained, the DunHuang starmap in 8th century.</li>
<li>According to the research on the stars and the documents carved on the korean whole sky constellation, Cheon-Sang-Yeol-Cha-Bun-Ya-Ji-Do in Chosun Dynasky, the map contains the sky of B.C.1C ~ A.D.1C.</li>
<li>Japan has the famous Kitora skymap painted in A.D.7C ~ 8C. </li>
</ul>

<h3>TODO clean those notes</h3>
 My work is based on the Cheon-Sang-Yeol-Cha-Bun-Ya-Zi-Do, the Korean Constellation map,
which was carved on the stone on 1395. (I will call it 'the map' afterward for convenient)
And the map has its origin on another skymap which existed about 2,000 years ago.
 The map has 1467 stars and about 190 constellations in it, and the shape is little bit 
diffrent than that of chinese.
 It was very difficult job, for the map is so old that only about 300 stars are found to 
match with the real stars officially.
(There is exact constellation made again in the late ChoSeon Dynasty, but It is my wish to 
build Korean Oldtime Constellation because of its long history and the beauty.)

 All the stars are drawn on a circle, so the equator seems smaller than the southern limit.
The problem is that the density of constellation does not change at all according to the 
position, and instead, the position and the size of the constellations were somewhat altered 
in which way I do not know.

 My assumption is that there should be no bright stars which do not belong to any 
constellations, because all the stars were thought to be the officer doing their mission in 
the sky at that time.
 So, here is my work, althought is not 100% perfect and can be changed anytime, it will show 
what the Korean Constellation is like. It has 272 constellations in it.
