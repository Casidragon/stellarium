<h2>Sami</h2>

<p>
The Sami or Lapps are considered the native population of northen 
Norway, Sweden, Finland and West Russia (Kola pennisula).

<p>
 My work is based on the work of Bo Lundmark "Bæivi Manno nastit" 
(Sun- and mooncult and astral and celest concepts among Sami, In swedish 1982)
, he based much of his work on the writings of the Sami artist and author Johan Turi.

The Sami constellations are probably very old but were recorden in writing during the 19th
century, why some might have been forgotten. The constellations and stars included here are all
connected to the dominant constellation "Sarva" the elk. The origin of this constellation dates
probably from the old hunter culture, before raindeers were domesticated.
</p>

<p>
Sarva consistst of our constellations Cassiopea, Perseus and parts of Auriga.
The elk is hunted by a number of hunters (constellatiions, stars). The Hunter Favdna (Arcturius) 
aims at the elk with his bow and arrow (Fauna davgge) (The big dipper). Favdna must aim well,
if he hits the skysupport (Polaris) (Boahjenaste), the the world will come to an end.
</p>

<p>
Favdna har a number of helpers. Galla (probably Procyon, Rigel or Sirius) and his sons 
(Gallabarneck)(Orions belt). I have chosen Procyon as Galla since Sirius is very hard to spot on
 the latitude where the Sami lives. The Skirunners (Cuoigahægjek) (Castor & Pollux), the runner (Vega).
Pleiades is calld Rougot (dogpack) or Calfpack (Miese-cora), probably dogs chasing the elk.
</p>

<p>
The milky way is called Bird-path (Lodde-raiddaras) or Year-mark (Jakke-mærka) as connect to the seasons.
Vega is called Guovso-naste, morning star, a star showing the morning is approaching. (similar to Arcturius in 
Norse skyculture).
</p>

<p>
That the number of constellations are quite small can to some extent be explained that Aurora Borealis drowns 
the light of most stars, but the latitude is also an explaination.
</p>

<p>
The Sami skyculture have similarities with other arctic and sub-artic cultures in eurasia, and as for most of 
them the culture has been lost before it was recorded properly.
