<h2>Sami</h2>

<p>The Sami people are considered to be the native population of northern Norway, Sweden, Finland and West Russia (the Kola Peninsula). 
More information can be found at 
<a href="http://www.eng.samer.se/">samer.se</a> and in the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sami_people">Wikipedia article about them</a>.</p>

<p>Stellarium's Sami sky culture is based on the work of Bo Lundmark <i>Bæi'vi mánno nástit</i> 
(Swedish title: <i>Sol- och månkult samt astrala och celesta föreställninga bland samerna</i> 
[<i>Sun and Moon cult and astral and celestial concepts among the Sami</i>], 1982), who based much of his work on the writings of the Sami artist 
and author Johan Turi.</p>

<p>The Sami constellations are probably very old but were recorded in writing during the 19th century, 
so some might have been forgotten. The constellations and stars included here are all connected to the dominant constellation <i>Sarva</i>, the elk. 
Sarva is the sami name for elk, an alternative name is Sarvvis, Bull elk.
 The origin of this constellation probably dates back to the old hunter culture, before reindeer were domesticated.</p>

<p><i>Sarva</i> consists of the Western constellations Cassiopeia, Perseus and parts of Auriga. 
The elk is hunted by a number of hunters (constellations and stars). 
The Hunter <i>Favdna</i> (also transcripted as Favtna) ((Arcturus) aims at the elk with his bow and arrow (<i>Fauna davgge</i>, the Big Dipper).
 Favdna must aim well, if he hits the Sky Support (<i>Boahjenaste</i>, the star Polaris), the world will come to an end.</p>

<p>Favdna has a number of helpers: <i>Galla</i> (probably Procyon, Rigel or Sirius - Procyon was chosen as Galla for this skyculture 
since Sirius is very hard to spot from the latitude where the Sami live) and his sons (<i>Gallabarneck</i>, Orion's belt); 
the Ski Runners (<i>Cuoigahægjek</i>, Castor and Pollux) and the Runner (Vega). The Pleiades are called <i>Rougot</i> (dogpack) or <i>Miese-cora</i> (calfpack), probably dogs chasing the elk. But there might exist more names.</p>

<p>The Milky Way is called Bird-path (<i>Lodde-raiddaras</i>) or Year-mark (<i>Jakke-mærka</i>) as connect to the seasons, where the milky way attains different names depending on the season.
In the sky chart of Johan Turi, one can observ a star <i>Guovso-naste</i>, morning star, that can be identified as Venus, but this is not certain as 
it can also be identified as Altair, a star showing the morning is approaching (similar to Arcturus in the Norse skyculture).</p>

<p>The small number of Sami constellations can be explained to some extent by the Aurora Borealis, as it drowns out the light of most stars, and by the high latitude, as it limits the portion of the celestial sphere that can be observed through the year.</p>

<p>The Sami skyculture has similarities with other arctic and sub-arctic cultures in Eurasia, and like most of 
them the culture has been lost before it was recorded properly.</p>

<p>The sami constallations can be observed on other sami artifacts connected to the old religion, why one can guess that the sky played an important role in the sami culture. 
One must be aware that the culture is not one culture but at least 3 different cultures depending on the geography. The South-sami, North-sami and russian sami, differs with slightly different languages.
