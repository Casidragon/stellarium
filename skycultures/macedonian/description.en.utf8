<h2>SKY MAP OF MACEDONIAN PEOPLE</h2>
<p>Ethnoastronomical researches among Macedonian people began in 1982, organized by the Planetarium at Youth Cultural Centre. In the past years, around 140 villages in Republic of Macedonia have been visited and over 1500 inhabitants have been interviewed and surveyed.    All collected information from the population have been published in the book “Sky over Macedonia” (Cenev G, 2004). An integral part of this book is the Sky map of Macedonian people which has been reconstructed based on the descriptions of constellations known to elderly inhabitants of Macedonian villages (Cenev G., 2000).</p>

<h3>Constellations</h3>
<ul>
<li>Mother Hen (Kvachka) (Quatʃka) is the best-known constellation, which is recognized by all elderly people in Macedonian villages, without any exception (fig.3). This name people use for the star cluster Pleiades</li>
<li>Rooster (Petal) (Petel): This is the name of the star Nat form the Auriga astronomical constellation.</li>
<li>Hawk (Јastreb) (Yastreb):  Hawk, as one of the most famous enemies of the Mother Hen and the Rooster, is right above them in an attacking position.  Bright star Capella (Kapela) from the Auriga astronomical constellation is actually known among people as Hawk.</li>
<li>Fox (Lisica) (Lysitsa): Fox is the second by importance natural enemy of the Mother Hen and the Rooster so it is obvious why people also “see” it on the sky.  Red color of the bright star Aldebaran from the Bull astronomical constellation is the reasons why people perceive it as a Fox ready to attack the Mother Hen and the Rooster.</li>
<li>Pigs (Svinji) (Sviƞi): Near to the Mother Hen, people on the sky noticed the star cluster Hyades. Scatted appearance of the stars of this cluster associated people to the image of pigs in a village yard, and so it’s called Pigs.</li>
<li>Yoke (Jarem) (Yarem): People under this name recognize group of stars in the Perseus astronomical constellation. Yoke for the oxen usually is found in village yards so that is why, as the previous constellation, is evidence of the general image of people and purpose given to this part of the sky.</li>
<li>Ploughman (Orach) (Oratʃ): Previously we mentioned that the Ploughman is one of the three main characters in the sky. The Ploughman is the name people gave to the bright star Betelgeuse in Orion astronomical constellation.  Despite the Betelgeuse, in building the image of this folk constellation,  some weaker and less bright starts from the surrounding are also taken into account, because people says that the Ploughman is image of  a person with goad as he returns home.</li>
<li>Plough with Oxen (Ralo so Volovi), (Ralɔ sɔ Vɔlɔvi): Astronomical constellation Orion with its numerous bright stars and distinctive pattern dominates on the winter sky and can be easily found. People from Macedonian villages usually point at the region around Orion’s belt saying that three bright stars and surrounding less bright stars create an image of a wooden Plough with two yoked oxen.</li>
<li>Wolves (Volci) (Voltsi): Near to the plough with oxen, which is left on a field, people see two wolves as well. Wolves are bright stars Sirius in Canis Major astronomical constellation and Procion in Canis Minor astronomical constellation.</li>
<li>Priest’s Straw (Popova Slama) (Popovᴧ Slᴧmᴧ): Our galaxy -Milky Way by its appearance is dominant on the summer sky </li>
<li>Threshing floor (Gumno) (Goumno): Circular and foggy appearance of the Andromeda’s galaxy (М31) evoked people to see the threshing floor with straw from where the Priest was stealing from his Godson.</li>
<li>Cross (Krst) (Krst): Complement with the people’s belief, when the Priest- thief saw God’s mighty he started running in panic and lost his cross on the way. So next to the Priest’s Straw there is the Cross.</li>
<li>Ears (Ushi) (Uʃi): By this common word used as a jargon, Macedonian villagers mark part of the wooden plough that goes into the soil, used for plowing. </li>
<li>Trivet (Pirustija) (Pirustiya): The trivet is metal device with three legs (tripod), which fits over the fireplace to support pans and kettles while preparing food.</li>
<li>Tongs (Mashi) (Maʃy):  The Tongs were used for the fire where the trivet is. Thus, the people’s constellation Tongs is very close to the constellation Trivet.</li>
<li>Low round wooden dining table (Sofra) (Sofra): Typical semi-circular shape of the astronomical constellation Corona Borealis evoked the image of wooden round table called sofra.</li>
<li>Auger (Svrdel) (Svrdǝl). People say that this is very big drill used for construction of the houses and is found inside the Priest’s Straw</li>
<li>Thieves (Aramii) (Arami:): Famous astronomical constellation Ursa Major among the people is described as group of thieves. Seven bright stars of the Ursa Major astronomical constellation are said to be thieves „because during the entire night they circle on the sky same as thieves that circle around houses“</li>
